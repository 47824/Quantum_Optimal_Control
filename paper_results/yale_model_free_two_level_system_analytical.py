"""This code sets the simplest RL algorithm (Policy Gradient) for solving a quantum control problem. The goal is the 
following: We have access to a quantum computer (here a simulator provided by IBM Q) containing one qubit. The qubit 
originally starts in the state |0>, and we would like to apply a quantum gate (operation) to bring it to the |1> 
state. To do so, we have access to a gate parametrized with an angle, and the RL agent must find the optimal angle 
that maximizes the probability of measuring the qubit in the |1> state. Optimal value for amplitude a (angle/2Ï€) is 
0.5. The RL agent chooses its actions (i.e. picks a random value for a) by drawing a number from a Gaussian 
distribution, of mean mu and standard deviation sigma. The trainable parameters are therefore those two latter 
variables (we expect the mean to be close to 0.5 and the std very low). The reward is a binary number obtained upon 
measurement of the circuit produced (only two possible outcomes can be measured). Note that this problem does contain
only one timestep per episode, meaning that there is no need to introduce any discount factor for future reward (gamma).
