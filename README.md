# Feedback-based Quantum Control using Reinforcement Learning 

This repository is dedicated to the writing of Python scripts enabling the realization of quantum control tasks based on
closed-loop optimization that incorporates measurements. We build upon the work of Vlad Sivak on Model-Free Quantum
Control with Reinforcement Learning (https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.011059) to enable a generic framework for arbitrary state preparation and quantum gate 
calibration based on Qiskit modules. The interest here is that this repo enables the execution of the algorithm over
both simulation and real IBM Backends seamlessly, and therefore enables an in-depth analysis of the robustness of the 
method for a variety of different backends. In the future, we will add compatibility with further providers.

The repo is currently divided in three main folders. The first one is the folder "paper_results", where adaptation of 
the state preparation algorithm developed by Sivak for bosonic systems is adapted to a multiqubit system simulated with
a Qiskit ``` QuantumCircuit``` running on a ```QasmSimulator``` backend instance.

The two other folders extend the work of Sivak by integrating quantum gate calibration procedures, that can be described 
using a usual gate level abstraction (that is one seeks to optimize gate parameters, in the spirit of a variational 
quantum algorithm), or at the pulse level abstraction, for more expressivity and harware-aware noise mitigation.

We briefly explain the overall logic of the algorithm below.

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an interaction-based learning procedure resulting from the interaction between two entities:
- an Environment: in our case the quantum system of interest formed of $n$ qubits, characterized by a quantum state $\rho\in \mathcal{H}$, where the dimension of Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is $d=2^n$ and from which 
observations/measurements $o_i \in \mathcal{O}$  can be extracted. Measurements could be retrieved as bitstrings ($\mathcal{O}= \{0, 1\}^{\otimes n}$) or as IQ pairs if state discrimination is not done a priori, as shown in this recent work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01169). The point here is that we restrict the observation space to values that can be easily retrieved from the actual quantum device.
- an Agent: a classical Neural Network on the PC, whose goal is to learn a stochastic policy $\pi_\theta(a|o_i)$  from which actions $a \in \mathbb{U}$ are sampled to be applied on the Environment to set it in a specific target state. Typically, the goal 
of the Agent in the frame of Quantum Optimal Control is to find actions (e.g., circuit/pulse parameters)
enabling the successful preparation of a target quantum state, or the calibration of a quantum gate operation.

Quantum Control has benefited from tremendous achievements in the past few years. Calibration methods coming from physical models enabling noise cancellation (e.g., DRAG, Dynamical Decoupling) or machine learning based methods based on experimental data have been jointly used to maximize average gate fidelities. However, they are yet to propose a dynamical and contextual error robustness. In fact, some of the noisy processes that may impact a quantum gate operation can have different effects on the quantum system of interest that may depend on the spatio-temporal context in which it is being applied. For example, consider the problem of calibrating a two-qubit gate between two specific qubits of a quantum processing unit (QPU) containing more than two qubits. In the context of a quantum circuit, some other gates may be applied on neighboring qubits in parallel to our target gate to minimize the duration of the circuit. It could even be so that before playing our target gate, the two qubits could be set in a non-trivial input state. The resulting output state fidelity could therefore depend on a variety of noisy quantum channels (in this case non-local crosstalk or Pauli errors related to other gates), whose effects on the target gate fidelity are specified uniquely by the actual quantum circuit. 

What we want to achieve here is to show that model-free quantum control with RL (Sivak et. al, https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.011059) is able to capture the contextual dependence of such target preparation task and to provide suitable error mitigation strategies. In the examples currently available, we explain the overall logic of the algorithm itself, and detail later how the context dependence can be encompassed through a tailor-made training procedure.

## 1. Describing the QuantumEnvironment
### a. Deriving the reward for the quantum control problem
As explained above, our framework builds upon the idea of transforming the quantum control task into a RL problem where an agent is missioned to probe and act upon an environment in order to steer it in a target state. The way this is usually done in RL is to introduce the concept of a reward signal $R$, which should be designed such that the maximization of this reward yields a set of actions providing a successful and reliable target preparation. 
For a quantum state preparation task, this reward should be designed such that:

$$\mathrm{argmax}_{|\psi\rangle}\,\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [R]= |\psi_{target}\rangle$$

Where the expectation value is empirically taken over a batch of actions sampled from the policy $\pi_\theta$ (Monte Carlo sampling) yielding different rewards. It is clear that the reward should therefore act as a proxy for a distance measure between quantum states, for example the fidelity. 
The average reward should therefore be a statistical estimator for the fidelity. The Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) scheme introduced in [2] gives us a protocol to build a single shot reward scheme based on Pauli expectation sampling. We take the same notation as in the paper below and write the corresponding protocol to derive the reward.

The Ô¨Ådelity between our desired pure state $\rho$ and the actual state $\sigma$ is given by:
$$F(\rho, \sigma)=\left(\mathrm{tr}\left[(\sqrt{\rho} \sigma \sqrt{\rho})^{1 / 2}\right]\right)^2=\mathrm{tr}(\rho \sigma)$$

Let $W_k \, (k=1,..,d^2)$ denote all possible Pauli operators acting on $n$ qubits, that is all $n$-fold tensor products of Pauli matrices ($I=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$, $\sigma_x=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$, $\sigma_y=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{pmatrix}$, $\sigma_z=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}$).

Define the characteristic function $$\chi_\rho(k)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho W_k/\sqrt{d})=\langle W_k\rangle_\rho/\sqrt{d}$$ 
where the expectation value is evaluated on the state $\rho$.

Since those Pauli operators form an orthogonal basis for the density operators under the Hilbert-Schmidt product, one can see that:

$$F(\rho, \sigma)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho \sigma)=\sum_k\chi_\rho(k)\chi_\sigma(k)=\sum_k\frac{\langle W_k\rangle_\rho\langle W_k\rangle_\sigma}{d}$$.

Note that for our target state $\rho$, we supposedly are able to evaluate analytically the expected value of each Pauli operator $\langle W_k\rangle_\rho$. However, we would have to experimentally sample from the quantum computer to deduce the value of $\langle W_k\rangle_\sigma$.
In the original DFE paper, the idea was to provide an estimation of the required number of samples to reach a certain accuracy on the fidelity estimation. However, in our RL case, we are not interested in systematically getting an accurate estimation, as we would like the agent to rather explore multiple trajectories in parameter space (for one fixed policy) in order to quickly evaluate if the chosen policy should be discarded, or if it should try to fine-tune it to push the reward even further. This fact is commonly known in RL as the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. What we do, in line with the protocol is to build an estimator for the fidelity by selecting a set of random Pauli observables $W_k$ to sample from the quantum computer by choosing $k\in\{1,...,d^2\}$ such that:

$$\mathrm{Pr}(k)=[\chi_\rho(k)]^2$$

Once those indices have been sampled, we compute the expectation values $\langle W_k\rangle_\sigma$ by directly sampling in the appropriate Pauli basis on the quantum computer. We let the user choose how many shots per expectation value shall be executed, as well as the number of indices $k$ to be sampled. The choice of those hyperparameters will have a direct impact on the estimation accuracy of the actual state $\sigma$ properties and can therefore impact the convergence of the algorithm. 
One can show that by constructing the estimator $X = \langle W_k\rangle_\sigma/\langle W_k\rangle_\rho$, it follows that:

$$\mathbb{E}_{k\sim \mathrm{Pr(k)}}[X]=F(\rho,\sigma)$$

We can define a single shot reward $R$ by replacing the actual expectation value $\langle W_k\rangle_\sigma$ by an empirical estimation $\mathbb{E}_\sigma[W_k]$, that is measure a finite number of times the created state $\sigma$ in the $W_k$ basis. In general, only the computational basis measurements are natively available on the quantum computer (specifically true for IBM backends), so additional local qubit rotations are  necessary before performing the measurement. This experimental workflow is automatically taken care of in our algorithm by the use of a Qiskit Estimator primitive (https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/how-to-getting-started-with-estimator.html).

Our single shot reward $R$ can therefore be defined as: 

$$R=\frac{1}{d}\langle W_k\rangle_\rho W_k/\mathrm{Pr}(k)$$.

It is easy to see that we have:

$$\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta, k\sim\mathrm{Pr}(k), \sigma} [R]=F(\rho, \sigma)$$



For a gate calibration task, we want to find parameters defining the quantum gate $G(a)$ that yield a high fidelity measure for all possible input states when comparing to the target $G_{target}$. We can therefore implement the same idea as target state preparation reward, but this time we add an averaging over all possible input states $|\psi_{input}\rangle$ such that for each input state, $G(a)|\psi_{input}\rangle=G_{target}|\psi_{input}\rangle$. The average gate fidelity is therefore given by:
$$\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta,\,|\psi_{input}\rangle, \, k\sim\mathrm{Pr}(k), \, \sigma} [R]=F(\rho, \sigma)$$.

In the code, each average is empirically done over specific hyperparameters that must be tuned by the user at each experiment:

- For the average over the policy ($\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[.]$): the user should adjust the ```batchsize``` hyperparameter, which indicates how many actions from one policy with fixed parameters should be drawn. 
- For the average over input states: at each episode of learning, we sample a different random input state $|\psi_{input}\rangle$ for which the corresponding target state $|\psi_{target}\rangle= G_{target}|\psi_{input}\rangle$ is calculated. Once the target state is deduced, we can start the episode by applying our parametrized gate and measuring the set of Pauli observables to design the reward circuit (Pauli basis rotation at the end of the circuit).
- For the average over the random Pauli observables to sample: the user should adjust the ```sampling_Pauli_space``` hyperparameter. This number will set the number of times an index $k$ shall be sampled based on the previously defined probability $\mathrm{Pr}(k)$. If the same index is sampled multiple times, this induces that the same Pauli observable will be sampled more accurately as the number of shots for one Pauli observable will scale as "number of times $k$ was sampled $\times N_{shots}$".
- The average over the number of shots to estimate each Pauli observable with a certain accuracy: The user should adjust the parameter ```n_shots```, this will be the minimum number of samples that each observable will be estimated with. 

Finally, the last hyperparameter of the overall RL algorithm is the number of epochs ```n_epochs```, which indicates how many times the policy parameters should be updated to try to reach the optimal near-deterministic policy enabling the successful preparation of the target state/gate.

### b. Modelling the quantum system through Qiskit: the ```QuantumCircuit```workflow

Our repo relies on the modelling of the quantum system as a class ```QuantumEnvironment```, which is characterized by the following attributes:

- ``` target: Dict```: a dictionary containing information about the target that the RL agent should prepare. It could either be a target state or a target gate. This dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - ```gate: qiskit.circuit.Gate```: if the target type is a gate, which quantum gate is the target the agent should calibrate
    - ```circuit: qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit```: If target type is a state, provides an ideal quantum circuit that should prepare the target state of interest
    - ```dm: qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix```: Alternatively to the ```circuit```key, one can provide a ```DensityMatrix```describing the target state of interest (if target type is a state).
    - ```register: Union[QuantumRegister, List[int]]```: List of qubits on which the target state/gate shall be prepared. The indices provided in this list should match the number of qubits addressed by the target gate/state.
    - ```input_states: Optional[List[Dict[Union["circuit", "dm"]]: Union[qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit, qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix]]]```:If target type is a gate, optional list of possible input states that should be prepared for forcing the agent to perform simultaneous successful state preparation. In order to maximize learning, the set of input states should be tomographically complete. Each input state should be provided as if it was a target state (either provide a quantum circuit enabling its perfect preparation, or a DensityMatrix). Note that it does not need to be provided, and the default will load a tomographically complete set.
- ```abstraction_level: str = Union["gate", "pulse"]```: The abstraction level at which the parametrized circuit enabling the target preparation is expressed. If the gate level is chosen, then the simulator that is used is a Statevector simulator, and significantly speeds up the simulation, unless another ```AerBackend``` object is provided in the ```Qiskit_config```below. Contrariwise, if the pulse level is chosen, all gates provided in the parametrized circuit should contain a dedicated pulse description, and the simulation of the pulse schedule associated to the circuit is done through Qiskit Dynamics module (https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics). 
- ```Qiskit_config: QiskitConfig```: A dataclass object containing necessary information to execute the algorithm on real/simulated hardware. It should contain the following keys:
    - ```backend: Optional[Union[qiskit.providers.BackendV1, qiskit.providers.BackendV2]]```: An IBM Backend on which should be executed the overall workflow. If a real backend is selected, then the user should ensure that he has opened an IBM account to access the resource, and that this backend is selected among the ones enabling the execution of Qiskit Runtime (see code examples about how to declare such real backend). If the ```abstraction_level```is set to ```"gate"```, and the user wants to run on a simulated noiseless backend, he can set the ```backend```to ```None```. Alternatively, the user can provide a custom ```AerBackend``` with a custom noise model. Finally, if the user wants to run the workflow on a simulated backend at the pulse level, he should provide a ```qiskit_dynamics.DynamicsBackend``` instance (see pulse level abstraction folder).
    - ```parametrized_circuit: Callable[qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit]```: A function taking as input a ```QuantumCircuit```instance and appending to it a custom parametrized gate (specified either as a pulse schedule or a parametrized gate depending on the abstraction level). This is the key function that should introduce circuit parameters (```qiskit.circuit.Parameter``` or ```qiskit.circuit.ParameterVector```) which will be replaced by the set of actions that the agent will apply on the system.
    - - ```service: Optional[QiskitRuntimeService]```: In case you want to use Qiskit Runtime on the cloud, specify the service you want to use to open a ```Session```.
    - Other optional arguments can be provided if a real backend is selected. They can be found in the notebook contained in the pulse level abstraction folder.
- ```sampling_Pauli_space: int```: As mentioned earlier, indicates how many indices should be sampled for estimating the fidelity from Pauli observables.
- ```n_shots: int```: Minimum number of shots per expectation value sampling subroutine.
- ```c_factor: float```: Normalization factor for the reward, should be chosen such that average reward curve matches average gate fidelity curve (if target type is a gate) or state fidelity curve (if target type is a state).


### c. The subtlety of the pulse level: Integrating Qiskit Dynamics and Qiskit Experiments

While a ```QuantumCircuit``` can be simulated using Statevector simulation when only dealing with the circuit level abstraction, and does not necessarily require an actual
backend (although one might want to use the ```ibmq_qasm_simulator```), simulating the circuit by providing a pulse level description requires a dedicated simulation backend.
As our main code revolves around Qiskit structure, we use the recently released Qiskit Dynamics extension, which is a framework for simulating arbitrary pulse schedules.
More specifically, we leverage the introduction of the ```DynamicsBackend``` object to emulate a real backend, receiving Pulse gates (you can learn more by checking Qiskit and Dynamics documentations).
The DynamicsBackend can be declared in two main ways:
1. Using the ```from_backend(BackendV1)``` method, which creates a ```DynamicsBackend``` carrying all the properties (in particular the Hamiltonian) of a real IBM backend.
2. Creating a custom Hamiltonian (or Linbladian) describing our quantum system of interest, and declare a ```Solver``` object which will be provided to the backend.

We provide examples of both declarations in the pulse_level_abstraction folder.

The subtlety behind this ```DynamicsBackend``` is that this backend does not carry calibrations for elementary quantum gates on the qubits.
This is an issue, as the current reward scheme is built on the ability to perform Pauli expectation sampling on the quantum computer.
Indeed, since we only have access to a Z-basis measurement in the backend, one needs to be able to perform Pauli basis rotation gates in order to ensure we can extract 
all Pauli operators. As a consequence, each qubit should have at the start calibrated Hadamard and S gates. The whole idea is to provide such baseline calibration for the
custom ```DynamicsBackend``` instance. To do so, we use the library of elementary calibrations provided in the Qiskit Experiments module (which provide calibration workflows for elementary gates).
Therefore, each time the ```QuantumEnvironment``` object is initialized with a ```DynamicsBackend``` object, a series of baseline calibrations will automatically start, such that the Estimator primitive (in this case the ```BackendEstimator``` present in Qiskit primitives)
can append the appropriate gates for all Pauli expectation value sampling tasks.
